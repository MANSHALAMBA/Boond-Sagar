# Boond-Sagar
Project Motivation and Description:
By the traditional techniques of water supply system, Governmentâ€™s water resources
department is supplying water without any assessment and analysis thus providing no
answerability to people of these areas.
To fix this situation we aim to build a website for government officials which will have a
prediction software based on machine learning at its core.
Services provided by the website will be as follows:

I. On the basis of weather conditions and data regarding rain patterns it will predict
duration after which next rainfall will take place.

II. And also the quality/quantity of next rainfall, so as to prepare well for epidemic
like situations in advance.

III. Also, the most important thing that our website will provide is that it will display
the ideal water requirement of each zonal area on the basis of data regarding
population density, development index etc.
Finally, by taking into account all the three factors that is by maintaining optimum trade
off between all these our software will come up with a effective plan for fair distribution
of available water among the different zones.
Thus enabling government of india to prepare well for the worst case scenarios.
Our website will provide clean and easy to use interface.
Authorized personnels will be able to update database convienently.
